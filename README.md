Trying to get busy with a little JavaScript Challenge~~
So, I discovered [Asabeneh](https://dev.to/asabeneh/30-days-of-javascript-challenge-56kd) Dev article and I think its more detailed than the initial Javascript30.

## Some Javascript random stuff to actually get myself busy. 
_I think I can actually finish this in a day or two but I will make sure to take the full 30 days_
>For the sake of fun, I'll add my own variations...
